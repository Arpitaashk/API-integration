API Integration with Python

This project demonstrates basic API integration using Python. It makes an HTTP GET request to a public API and displays structured data based on the response. The project showcases how to send requests, handle responses, and display output in a Python environment.



Project Overview

The script connects to a **placeholder JSON API** and retrieves data (in this case, details about posts). It can be easily modified to fetch data from other APIs with little effort.



Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `requests` – For sending HTTP requests
- `json` – To handle and parse response data
